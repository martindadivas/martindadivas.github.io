            <h3>About Martin</h3>
            <p>While attending college, I  took the leap of dropping out in order to pursue business pursuits.  My first successful venture was a military contracting firm. I then went on to co-found Corrizon Global LLC with two other partners.  Moving forward, I want to transition more into the tech industry.</p>
            <p>In order to fulfill my goals of transitioning into the tech industry, I have enrolled at Thinkful to gain necessary skills as a software developer.</p>
            <p></p>
